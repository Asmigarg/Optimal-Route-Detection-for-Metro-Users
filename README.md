# Optimal Route Detection for Metro Users

## Project Description

**Optimal Route Detection for Metro Users** is a Java-based command-line application designed to assist metro users in finding the shortest route between two stations. The application uses graph and heap data structures and employs Dijkstra's algorithm for efficient route computation. This project is targeted towards enhancing user experience by providing quick and accurate route recommendations.

## Features

- **Shortest Path Calculation:** Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the optimal route between two metro stations.
- **Dynamic Data Structures:** Utilizes graph and heap structures for efficient route management.
- **Command-Line Interface:** Easy-to-use CLI for users to input stations and view results.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Data Structures:** Graph, Heap
- **Algorithm:** Dijkstra's Algorithm

---

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 11 or above
- **IDE (Optional):** IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or any text editor
- **Command Line:** Terminal, Command Prompt, or any CLI tool
